# 📊 PhonePe Data Exploration and Visualization (EDA)

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on **PhonePe transaction data** to gain insights into digital payment trends across India.  
It explores datasets related to transactions, users, states, and other key metrics, using Python for **data cleaning**, **visualization**, and **trend analysis**.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Analyze PhonePe data to understand transaction behavior across states and categories.
- Identify top-performing regions, transaction types, and user demographics.
- Create visual representations (bar charts, maps, line plots) for better interpretability.
- Derive insights about digital payment growth and adoption.

## 📈 Key Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Imported CSV/JSON files from the PhonePe dataset.  
   - Handled missing values and normalized column names.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Computed summary statistics.  
   - Visualized transaction counts, amounts, and user trends.

3. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - State-wise choropleth maps of transaction density.  
   - Yearly growth trends in digital payments.  
   - Top 10 states by transaction volume.  
   - Correlation between users and transaction amounts.

4. **Conclusions & Insights**  
   - Identification of high-usage regions (e.g., Maharashtra, Karnataka).  
   - Growth patterns in digital transactions post-2020.  
   - User adoption trends showing steady rise in digital payments.
